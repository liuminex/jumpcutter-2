### Jumpcutter 2

> Removes silent frames from videos

Original code from <a href="https://github.com/carykh/jumpcutter">this</a> repo. A lot of improvements have been made. The output is a number of shorter videos, you need to merge them manuallly (suggested software: Avidemux).

- check out the code for more details.
- currently works only for mp4 videos (again, if you need conversion use Avidemux)
- some comments are old and may be inaccurate

usage:
```bash
# omit the .mp4 extension
python3 jumpcutter2.py --input my_video
```
